This is a reusable script to fetch all notifications for a particular customerID.

It works by using a variable for @customerID and passing it a value for this variable when we call it.

We can run the stored procedure with a specific customerID by running the following command:

    EXEC spGetNotificationsForCustomer @customerID = 3

This will get all messages sent to the customer with the customerID = 3.
