This stored procedure allows the an admin to send a notification to a customer.

We use a variable for:

> admin
> customer
> message

These dynamic values make it reusable.

All we have to do is execute the script with the values we wish to pass. 

Here is an example of how we can execute this stored procedure:

	EXEC spSendNotification @adminID = 1, @customerID = 3, @message = 'Due to maintenance...';

This script would send a notification to customer with the CustomerID = 3 from the admin account with the adminID = 1 with the following string saved to @message.

It automatically sets the notification's date and initial status to 'unread'.
