How to use:

Step 1: Check all notifications by running the following:

    SELECT * FROM tblNotifications;

This will show all of the notifications currently in the database. Take note of the notificationID that matches the one you wish to erase.

Step2: Delete the notification using this procedure:

    EXEC spDeleteNotification @notificationID = 1; -- Replace with actual notificationID you wish to remove.

This will remove that notification.
